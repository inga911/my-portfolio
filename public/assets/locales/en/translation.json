I have a long experience in team sports and being in a team environment, so I feel good being part of a team, overcoming challenges and obstacles, but I am also able to work independently. Realizing that I wanted to change my career direction, I started this journey with Full-Stack | PHP courses. After long hours of study, I felt tired, but at the same time energetic. Energized by the work put in and the progress made. Considering all my previous work experience, I realized that IT is my place. I feel like I have finally found my career path. I am constantly improving my knowledge and currently have experience with PHP, Laravel, React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, MySQL, Node.js, PhpMyAdmin, Bootstrap. I look forward to the opportunity to apply the accumulated knowledge in creating professional websites and apps and add value to your team and organization.",
