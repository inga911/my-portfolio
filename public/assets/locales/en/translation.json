I decided to dive into these vast areas. After weighing all the benefits and risks, I started this path with Back-End | PHP courses, to which I devoted all my free time. Through various work experiences, I have gained various skill sets, such as paying attention to small details, which is useful when creating websites/apps, communicating with clients - I am able to listen and properly respond to their needs, working in a team to achieve common goals and contributing effectively to the project. I have experience with Windows system, PHP, Laravel, React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS, MySQL, VSCode, Node.js, Bootstrap. I look forward to the opportunity to apply my accumulated knowledge to create professional websites and apps. I am determined to constantly improve my skills.",
